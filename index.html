			Hi, I'm Taika (he/him or they/them pronouns)<br>
			<b>CS Student and Interdisciplinary Researcher</b><br>
			Passion areas - Full stack development and continuous learning
		</p>

		<p>
			I love learning about other people's cultures and traveling to historical sites when I can. I have participated in martial arts -- shorin-ryu karate and then taekwondo -- since I was a child so one of my proudest accomplishments is keeping up with that.

		<p>
			I am a Student at the University of Michigan School of Information. <br>
			
			My entry is a little bit nontraditional. I started out at the University of Michigan studying biomedical engineering. Then I switched majors to kinesiology and neurophysiology because it was where engineering concepts are applied to improve patient outcomes.
		</p>
		<p>
			After graduating, I applied for research positions and graduate school rather than clinical roles. I wanted to increase my technical and critical thinking skills. Through my work in research I have strengthened my passion in increasing the accessibility of resources and products to others.
